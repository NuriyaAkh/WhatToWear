# WTWR (What to Wear?) Application

## About the project

**Full-stack application.** Use the following frameworks:

- React.js
- Node.js + Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose

A simple app that suggests a selection of outfits based on the weather forecast. It will use the person's wardrobe and aspects of todayâ€™s weather as inputs.

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.
